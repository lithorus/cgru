Lightwave
=========

Job submission plugin
---------------------

Jobs can be submitted from within Layout, but the plugin must be added first.
Alt + F11 > Add Plug-ins, then navigate to and add :code:`%CGRU_LOCATION%\plugins\lightwave\afanasy_submitter.py`
Alt + F10, search for afanasy in the search bar. The plugin should show in the left. Click and drag it to the desired location in the menu.

On first use, a config file will be written to `afanasy_submitter.cfg` alongside the user's LighWave configs.
Logs are written to the `afanasy_submitter_logs` subfolder.
